# CS431-Project1
Implementation of 4 different scheduling algorithms: First come first serve, shortest job first, round robbin, and lottery. 

# Compilation Steps:
  # g++ main.cpp Tuple.cpp
  # ./a.out
This will generate 20 different .csv files, as a result from reading in 4 different test data and calling 5 scheduling algorithms ( original 4 algorithms + 1 round robbin with a different time quanta).
